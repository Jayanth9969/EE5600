\section{Problem}

A die is thrown twice and the sum of the 
numbers appearing is observed to be 6. What
is the probability that the number 4 has appeared 
at least once? \\ \\ 

\section{Solution}

\begin{enumerate}
    Let A represent of all possible pairs from the die that makes sum 6.\\ 
    n(A) represents Number of elements in set A.
    \begin{align}
        A &= \{(1,5),(2,4),(3,3),(4,2),(5,1)\} \\ 
        n(A) &= 5 
    \end{align}

    Let B represent all possible pairs from the die that have atleast one 4\\ 
    n(B) represents Number of elements in set B.
    \begin{align}
        B &= \{(1,4),(4,1),(2,4),(4,2),(3,4),(4,3),(4,4),(4,5),(5,4),(4,6),(6,4)\}\\
        n(B) &= 11
    \end{align}
    Now,
    Let C represent all possible pairs from the die that makes sum 6 and having atleast one 4 in each pair.So,\\ 
    n(C) represents Number of elements in C.then,
    \begin{align}
        C &= A \cap B \\ 
        C &= \{(4,2),(2,4\}\\ 
        n(C) &= 2 
    \end{align}
    
    Probabilty that number 4 appearing atleast once given condition that sum of numbers is 6 is given by $Pr(B|A)$ 
    \begin{align}
        Pr(B|A) &= \frac{Pr(A \cap B)}{Pr(A)} \\
        &= \frac{Pr(C)}{Pr(A)} \\ 
        &= \frac{\frac{n(C)}{36}}{\frac{n(A)}{36}}\\
        &= \frac{n(C)}{n(A)}\\
        &= \frac{2}{5} \\ 
        &= 0.4
    \end{align}
    Thus probability that the number 4 has appeared at least once when a die is thrown is twice and sum of numbers Observed is 6 is 0.4.
